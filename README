This is a Perl interface to the client facilities of XML-RPC for
C/C++ (aka Xmlrpc-c).

XML-RPC is a quick-and-easy way to make procedure calls over the
Internet.  It converts the procedure call into XML document, sends it
to a remote server using HTTP, and gets back the response as XML.  See
<http://www.xmlrpc.com>.


Also see RPC::XML.  That serves the same purpose, but is is Perl all
the way down to the operating system.  Its modules call other Perl
modules that provide HTTP and XML services, and those call other Perl
modules, etc.  By contrast, RPC::Xmlrpc_c::Client calls executable
(machine language) libraries which are part of XML-RPC For C/C++.  It
requires much less CPU time.  See below for details.

Prerequisite: XML-RPC For C/C++.  You must have this installed on your
system before building the RPC-Xmlrpc_c package.  You must have a
working 'xmlrpc-c-config' shell command too; otherwise, you'll have to
modify the Makefile.PL's to tell them how to link C code with your
XML-RPC For C/C++ installation.

You need Release 1.09 (December 2006) or better of XML-RPC For C/C++.

XML-RPC For C/C++ probably will not work out-of-the-box on anything
but Unix.

PERFORMANCE
-----------

Compared to the RPC-XML package (RPC::XML::Client, etc):

In an experiment with a simple "add two integers" RPC in December
2006, a Perl program (which does nothing else) took 3 times as much
CPU time to start up, perform one RPC, and report the result with
RPC::XML::Client as with RPC::Xmlrpc_c::Client.  Subsequent RPCs (with
the same client object, but everything else repeated) took 10 times as
much CPU time with RPC::XML:Client as with RPC::Xmlrpc_c::Client.
